# Kairo

> **Aerodrome Safe LP Agent** · Your agent acts. Kairo decides.

Kairo is the consent and policy layer for autonomous LP management on Base. A user installs the **Aerodrome Steward** agent, sets a leash in plain English ("rebalance up to $500, only into vetted pools, only if APR uplift beats 4%"), and Kairo enforces it. Every decision lands as a public, verifiable receipt.

Built for the **[OpenPandora Early Forge](https://aomi.dev)** — Aerodrome track.

## Why Kairo

**The problem.** AI agents are increasingly trusted with on-chain action. Today the only two options are "give the agent your private key" or "approve every transaction yourself." Neither scales. Real LP autopilots need to act on signals you'd never see in time — gauge weight shifts, emissions changes, depegs — but they need a leash short enough to keep you in custody.

**The pattern.** A consent layer that sits between autonomous agents and the user's wallet. Three guarantees:

1. **On-chain policy enforcement.** Your policy lives in `KairoPolicy.sol` on Base Sepolia. The off-chain engine *reads* from it as the source of truth — your leash can't be silently rewritten by a compromised server.
2. **Aerodrome-native rules.** Generic spend caps aren't enough for LP. Kairo's policy primitives include min APR delta, max impermanent loss tolerance, pool allowlist, gauge allowlist, and an auto-claim threshold.
3. **Simulation-first.** Every proposal is simulated against live chain state before the user is asked. Aligned with [Aomi's transaction pipeline](https://aomi.dev/docs/about-aomi) — no surprise calldata, no waste-gas reverts.

## The Steward agent

**Aerodrome Steward** is the demo agent that ships with v1. It runs on a schedule:

- Reads the user's Aerodrome positions from Base mainnet
- Reads live gauge weights from `Voter.sol` to spot emission shifts
- Proposes typed actions: `rebalance`, `claim_rewards`, `add_liquidity`, `vote_for_gauge`, `swap`
- Every proposal is simulated, evaluated against the user's policy, and either auto-approved, queued for the user, or denied — with the full reasoning attached to the receipt

The persona is **Mei**, a part-time LP with ~$5k across 2–3 Aerodrome pools who wants yield without checking gauges every Sunday. Full persona spec in [`docs/PRODUCT.md`](./docs/PRODUCT.md).

## The "Rogue Steward" demo

Three scenarios, one wallet:

1. **Auto-approved.** Steward proposes a $200 rebalance with +5.2% APR delta. Within policy. Auto-executes. Receipt logged.
2. **Asks first.** Steward proposes a $1,500 rebalance. Over the per-action cap. Routed to the user — Telegram in week 2, in-app prompt today.
3. **Blocked.** Steward proposes adding liquidity to a pool not on the user's allowlist. Denied at the policy layer. Receipt records the rejected attempt with the exact rule that triggered.

The receipt page is the share artifact. Mei can post it on Farcaster, tweet it, screenshot it for friends. The audit trail is a product surface.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter web exec prisma db push        # local SQLite
pnpm dev                                      # http://localhost:3000

# Seed the dashboard with demo receipts (in another terminal)
pnpm seed:demo 0xYourWallet

# Run the contract test suite
pnpm contracts:test
```

Optional: run the Steward agent loop against a real Base wallet:

```bash
STEWARD_WALLET=0xYourWallet pnpm steward
```

## What makes Kairo different

- **Aerodrome-native policy primitives.** APR delta thresholds, impermanent loss tolerance, pool/gauge allowlists, auto-claim limits. Rules that actually mean something for LP, not generic spend caps.
- **On-chain enforcement on Base.** `KairoPolicy.sol` is the source of truth; the off-chain engine reads from it and refuses to forward any action that exceeds the rules.
- **Simulation-first proposals.** Every action is forked-simulated against live chain state before the user is asked. No surprise calldata, no waste-gas reverts.
- **Public, shareable receipts.** Every decision becomes a URL with an OG-card preview. The audit trail is a product surface, not a debugging tool.
- **Plain-English policy.** Type your leash in natural language — "rebalance up to $500, only if APR uplift beats 4%, auto-claim under $50" — and Kairo parses it into structured rules.
